Artifact Origin: CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle
Artifact Name:  Java Web Based Travel Application Slideshow

I plan on showcasing my knowledge and skills in all three areas, software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures,
and databases, using a single artifact from CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle. The final project of this course was a simple 
Java application that displayed a list of five health and wellness destinations in slideshow format. I am going to completely
transform this project, building on its complexity and enhancing its functionality in all three key areas. First, I will show my 
software engineering and design skills by re-engineering it from a simple java slideshow to a full Travel Application using C# 
programming language and XAML.  I will design it as a Windows 10 mobile application with a full framework, navigation, and user 
interaction capabilities. 

I will display my knowledge of Algorithms and Data Structures by creating a picklist of destination options that a user can select
from to generate a customized top five destination list. I plan to further enhance the previously simple application by including
sorting and filtering of the data for user consumption. I will by add the ability for the user to sort the destination list output
based on either price (highest to lowest or lowest to highest) or by destination rating.
 
I will demonstrate my understanding of databases by creating a database structure which holds customer information in JSON format.
The data will include user login names and passwords and user profile/preference data. I will then parse and transform the JSON data 
for use in my application. The user will then be able to create an account or login to their existing account (for the project I will 
create some test dummy accounts) to set and access their travel preferences. I will then use this stored data to set search options 
when the user chooses to do a search using their profile data. I will also update the JSON data when the user changes their 
profile/preferences. I will include the ability for a user to mark destination options as favorites using a heart icon and store their 
favorite selections as part of their user metadata. I will then provide a method where the user can show their favorite destinations
as a sorted list, which exhibits both database and algorithm/data structure knowledge. 

I chose this particular artifact, the Travel slideshow application, because the user focus group for this application requested similar 
modifications. However, their requests/suggestions were not required nor incorporated in the final design of the application. By 
fulfilling my enhancement plan as outlined and recreating the application as a mobile Windows 10 C#/XAML app, I will bring their
suggestions/input to life while simultaneously demonstrating my knowledge of all three key areas.  I will show my ability to engineer 
and design an application, by transferring the original app into another program language and redesigning its functionality from start
to finish using the software development and programming guidelines I have learned throughout my Computer Science Coursework. I will 
exhibit my understanding of data structures and algorithms with the incorporation of different sorting options and the use of
vectors/arrays to store user metadata. Additionally, I will display my database skills by adding a database and database interactions
for user login/registration, loading and saving user profiles, and loading and saving user preferences/favorites metadata.
